Hello, this is the explanation about linux booting!

Booting is a process that runs on startup to starts/loads the Operating System (OS)

The process of booting is the initial set of operations that are executed when
the computer is being switched on.

The first thing to do is turning on the computer, then the CPU will jump to BIOS
address (0xFFFF0). Then, BIOS itself will runs POST (Power-On Self Test). Then,
it will find bootable devices. Then it will load and execute boot sector from MBR,
Finally, it will load the OS.
